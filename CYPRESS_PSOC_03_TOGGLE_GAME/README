# A: 2-Player Toggle Ping Pong Game

## Overview
This project is a 2-player toggle ping pong game implemented on a Cypress programmable SoC using C programming language for the hardware side and MATLAB GUI library for the graphical user interface. The game utilizes the touch pads on the Cypress development board for player input, which are converted into characters and sent serially via UART between the PSoC code and the GUI. Each player takes turns tapping the touch pads to control the paddles in the game. The game interface is designed using MATLAB GUI components to provide a user-friendly experience.

## Features
- 2-player toggle ping pong game with touch pad control.
- MATLAB GUI library for graphical user interface.
- Serial communication via UART between PSoC code and MATLAB GUI.
- Responsive gameplay with real-time paddle control.
